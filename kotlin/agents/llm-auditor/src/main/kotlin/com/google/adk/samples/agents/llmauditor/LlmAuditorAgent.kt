 * The LLM Auditor is a sequential multi-agent pipeline that fact-checks
 * LLM-generated answers. It chains two sub-agents:
 *
 * 1. **Critic**: Identifies claims in the answer, verifies each claim using
 *    Google Search, and produces an audit report with verdicts.
 * 2. **Reviser**: Takes the original answer and the critic's findings, then
 *    minimally edits the answer to correct any inaccuracies.
